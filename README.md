## What This Does

Every 15 minutes, Polymarket runs a binary market: *"Will BTC go up or down?"*

These markets resolve against **Chainlink's BTC/USD data stream** — if the Chainlink price at the end of the window is greater than or equal to the price at the start, UP wins. Otherwise, DOWN wins.

This bot trades those markets autonomously. It wakes up 60 seconds before each window, captures the **Chainlink opening price** (the exact number it needs to beat), analyzes BTC using five technical signals across three price oracles, places a real signed order via Polymarket's CLOB, then goes back to sleep. Rinse and repeat, 96 times a day.

It also has two optional edge engines — an **arbitrage scanner** that catches mispricings between the UP and DOWN sides, and a **hedge module** that protects open positions when the signal flips.

## Quickstart

**1. Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**2. Export your Polymarket wallet keys**

Go to [reveal.polymarket.com](https://reveal.polymarket.com) to get your private key, then grab your deposit address from Polymarket's deposit page.

```bash
export POLY_PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key"
export POLY_FUNDER="0xYourDepositAddress"
export POLY_SIG_TYPE=1
```

> **SIG_TYPE:** `1` = email/Magic login (most common), `2` = browser wallet (MetaMask), `0` = direct EOA

**3. Run**

```bash
python bot.py --bankroll 100
```

The bot is now live, placing real orders with a $100 bankroll. Every 15 minutes it wakes, decides, trades, sleeps.

## How It Works

### Timing

The bot is **clock-synced** — it doesn't poll randomly. It calculates the exact second to fire before each 15-minute boundary:

```
11:59:00  →  analyze + trade    (targeting 12:00 boundary)
12:14:00  →  analyze + trade    (targeting 12:15 boundary)
12:29:00  →  analyze + trade    (targeting 12:30 boundary)
12:44:00  →  analyze + trade    (targeting 12:45 boundary)
```

Between windows it polls the clock every 5 seconds. No wasted API calls, no drift.

### Pipeline (each cycle)

```
Anchor ─→ Oracle ─→ Strategy ─→ Risk Check ─→ Market Discovery ─→ [Arb] ─→ [Hedge] ─→ Execute ─→ Resolve
```

**Anchor** — Captures the Chainlink BTC/USD price at the start of the current 15-minute window. This is the **price to beat** — Polymarket resolves UP if the closing Chainlink price >= this number. The bot records it once per window and passes it to the strategy.

**Oracle** — Fetches BTC/USD from three sources: Chainlink (via Polymarket's RTDS websocket at `wss://ws-live-data.polymarket.com`), Binance, and CoinGecko. Chainlink is primary since it's the resolution oracle. Binance and CoinGecko provide redundancy and divergence checks. Rejects stale prices (>30s) and flags divergence >1%.

**Strategy** — Runs five weighted technical signals on 100 recent 15-minute candles:

| Signal | Weight | What it does |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Price vs Open** | **35%** | **Where is BTC now relative to the window open? Directly maps to resolution.** |
| Momentum | ~20% | Price delta over N candles — raw directional pressure |
| RSI | ~16% | 14-period Wilder's — detects overbought/oversold extremes |
| MACD | ~16% | 12/26/9 crossover — trend momentum + histogram strength |
| EMA Cross | ~13% | Fast(5) / Slow(15) crossover — short-term trend shift |

When the window opening price is available, Price vs Open takes 35% weight and the other four signals share the remaining 65%. If BTC has already drifted +0.15% above the open, Price vs Open heavily pushes toward UP because that's exactly what Polymarket will check at resolution.

The strategy also applies a **fee-adjusted edge check** — Polymarket charges ~1.5% taker fee at mid-probability. If the expected edge is below the fee threshold, the bot skips the trade even if confidence is above 60%.

Outputs a direction (UP/DOWN/HOLD) and a confidence score. Only trades when confidence ≥ 60% AND edge exceeds estimated fees.

**Risk** — Enforces daily trade cap (20), daily loss limit (15%), consecutive loss cooldown (5 losses → 60min pause), and position sizing via quarter-Kelly criterion.

**Execution** — Uses `py-clob-client` SDK to place an EIP-712 signed market order (fill-or-kill) directly on Polymarket's Central Limit Order Book. Parses the response for actual fill price and transaction hashes.

## CLI Reference

```bash
python bot.py --bankroll 500                # Run with $500, 24/7
python bot.py --bankroll 100 --cycles 10    # Run 10 windows then stop
python bot.py --bankroll 200 --arb          # Enable arbitrage scanner
python bot.py --bankroll 200 --hedge        # Enable hedge engine
python bot.py --bankroll 500 --arb --hedge  # Everything on
python bot.py --bankroll 500 --dashboard    # Enable live dashboard server
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--bankroll` | 500 | Starting capital in USD |
| `--cycles` | 0 | Max entry windows (0 = run forever) |
| `--arb` | off | Enable arbitrage scanner |
| `--hedge` | off | Enable hedge engine |
| `--dashboard` | off | Start WebSocket server on :8765 for live dashboard |

**Ctrl+C** → graceful shutdown. Saves performance snapshot, cancels pending orders, closes connections.

## Edge Engines

Both off by default. Toggle them with CLI flags.

### Arbitrage (`--arb`)

Every cycle, the arb scanner checks all active BTC 15-min markets for mispricing. On Polymarket, UP + DOWN should sum to ~$1.00. When they don't, it's free money:

```
UP = $0.45  ·  DOWN = $0.48  ·  total = $0.93
Buy both sides → one always resolves to $1.00
Profit = $0.07 per share (7.5%) — zero risk
```

These gaps are rare on liquid markets but they appear on fast-moving 15-minute windows. The scanner catches them automatically.

| Setting | Default | What it controls |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| `arb_threshold` | 0.98 | Only arb if UP + DOWN < this |
| `arb_min_edge_pct` | 1.0% | Ignore edges smaller than this |
| `arb_size_usd` | $10 | How much to bet per side |

### Hedge (`--hedge`)

Tracks your open positions. If the strategy flips direction while you're holding, the hedge engine buys the opposite side to lock in a guaranteed outcome:

```
Holding UP @ $0.55 → strategy flips to DOWN (confidence 0.70)
Buy DOWN @ $0.40 → total exposure = $0.95
One side pays $1.00 → locked profit = $0.05 per share
```

If the combined cost exceeds $1.00, the hedge still caps your downside — you lose less than riding out an unhedged position.

| Setting | Default | What it controls |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| `hedge_min_confidence` | 0.65 | Only hedge if the flip signal is this strong |

## Logs

Every action is logged to structured JSONL for full auditability:

| File | What's in it |
|------|-------------|
| `logs/trades.jsonl` | Every order — direction, size, fill price, order ID, tx hashes |
| `logs/strategy.jsonl` | Every decision — signal values, confidence, drift from open, hold reasons |
| `logs/oracle.jsonl` | Every price fetch — Chainlink price, window open, source prices, spread |
| `logs/errors.log` | Errors with stack traces |
| `data/performance.json` | Latest cumulative stats snapshot |

---

## Safety

The bot has multiple layers of protection to prevent catastrophic losses:

**Chainlink-anchored** — The bot uses the same oracle Polymarket resolves against (Chainlink BTC/USD via RTDS websocket). It knows the exact price it needs to beat, not just a generic direction guess.

**Market restriction** — Hardcoded to BTC 15-minute UP/DOWN binary markets only. It will never trade any other asset or market type.

**Oracle consensus** — Chainlink is primary (resolution oracle), Binance and CoinGecko provide redundancy. Rejects stale data (>30s old). Alerts when source spread exceeds 1%.

**Daily circuit breaker** — If cumulative daily losses exceed 15% of your bankroll, the bot stops trading for the rest of the day.

**Loss streak cooldown** — After 5 consecutive losses, the bot pauses for 60 minutes before resuming.

**Conservative sizing** — Quarter-Kelly criterion with a hard $25 cap per trade. Even at maximum confidence, a single trade won't exceed 5% of capital.

**No keys, no trades** — The CLOB client won't initialize without a valid `POLY_PRIVATE_KEY`. There's no way to accidentally execute orders.

**Full audit trail** — Every oracle query, strategy decision, risk check, and trade execution is logged to JSONL with timestamps. Nothing happens off the record.

## Dependencies

```
aiohttp>=3.9.0           Async HTTP + WebSocket for Chainlink RTDS, Binance, Gamma, dashboard server
py-clob-client>=0.34.0   Polymarket CLOB SDK — order signing + execution
web3==6.14.0              Ethereum interaction (pinned to avoid eth-typing conflicts)
python-dotenv>=1.0.0      Environment variable loading
```

---

## Dashboard

The included `dashboard.jsx` is a React component that connects to the bot via WebSocket for live data.

**Start the bot with the dashboard server:**

```bash
python bot.py --bankroll 500 --dashboard
```

This starts a WebSocket server on `ws://localhost:8765`. The dashboard connects automatically and displays live data — BTC price, signals, positions, equity, and strategy decisions — updating after every trading cycle.

**How to use it:**

1. Run the bot with `--dashboard`
2. Open `dashboard.jsx` as a React artifact in Claude, or drop it into any React project
3. It auto-connects to `ws://localhost:8765` and shows live state
4. If no bot is running, it falls back to simulated demo data so you can preview the layout

The dashboard shows: hero profit banner, stat cards (bankroll, P&L, window open price, strategy direction, risk), equity curve, full signal array with Price vs Open, engine status, oracle sources, and the raw decision log from each cycle.
